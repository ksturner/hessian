Fast Python Hessian Module
==========================

![The Hessian](hessian.jpg)


I don't know what this image says about a Hessian api, but at any rate, if you
need to interface with a Hessian api (They) and the regular Python version is
just not performing fast enough, then this module is what you're looking for.
It simply wraps the existing C++ version of the Hessian protocol as a Python
module for your computing pleasure. Now you can get all the speed of the
low-level compiled version from within your Python code without feeling like
the api looks/feels like the picture above.

WARNING
-------

*THIS MODULE IS NOT FULLY COMPLETED!* While it wraps the C++ code, the
conversion of the objects into Python objects was not fully completed. The
reason for this was the discovery that the C++ code parse for v1.0 of the
Hessian spec which was not the version I needed to connect to. Rather than
invest the significant amount of energy that was required to update a library I
didn't write to v2.0, I decided to abort and find a non-Hessian solution to the
original project that was needing a faster Hessian implementation. My apologies
for the half-implemented dump() function in the code below, but feel free to
submit patches if you work on it.
